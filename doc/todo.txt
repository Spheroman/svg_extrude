Tests:
  * Not all tests are executed (?)

Functionality:
  * Use OpenSCAD to create STL files
  * Warning if a polygon does not have evenodd fill rule
  * Rounding colors with name, use name in file name and optionally in group
    name

Organization:
  * Make SvgToScad usable on its own

Future work:
  * Operate without OpenSCAD
      * Internal difference, triangulization, STL generation
      * But keep the SVG to SCAD part
  * Move SVG import functionality to OpenSCAD and simply use that
