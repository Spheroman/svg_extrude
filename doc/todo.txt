TODOs

Output:
  * json
  * single-3mf
  * additional geometry on top (configurable height), with optional color selection
  * Status message: groups, each with number of polygons and number of points
  * Remove prints in cjlano-svg
  * Comments in scad file

Implementation:
  * Type annotations (-> TODO)
  * Should context managers be annotated with -> Generator[...] (type hints)?

Cleanup:
  * remove Color.invert
  * Clean up method order in classes

Reading:
  * Warning if a polygon does not have evenodd fill rule
  * SVG description
  * Coordinates? OpenSCAD file has negative y. Document it.

Rendering:
  * Use customizer to select groups instead of writing different SCAD files?
  * Flipping

Colors:
  * Rounding colors with name, use name in file name and optionally in group
    name
  * In ScadFile, define colors like `red = "#ff0000";`
  * Use Î”E for color difference
  * Allow specifying colors by CSS specification

Misc:
  * Are all SVG IDs OK for creating OpenSCAD identifiers?
  * Make sure we can't get collisions: an "outer" shape will currently create an
    "outer_only" module which will collide with an "outer_only" shape.


Documentation:
  * Meaning of precision

Future work:
  * Operate without OpenSCAD
      * CSG difference
      * Triangulation
      * Output file (STL, 3MF, potentially others) generation
