Tests:
  * Not all tests are executed (?)

Reading:
  * Warning if a polygon does not have evenodd fill rule

Geometry:
  * Allow scaling

Interface:
  * Make SvgToScad usable on its own
  * Output to current directory, not to input file directory
  * Allow specifying output directory
  * Allow specifying output base name
  * Allow (or require) specifying thickness
  * Allow specifying precision

Rendering:
  * Render to a file for that supports multiple objects? AMF?
  * Use customizer to select groups instead of writing different SCAD files?

Colors:
  * Rounding colors with name, use name in file name and optionally in group
    name
  * In ScadFile, define colors like `red = "#ff0000";`
  * Use Î”E for color difference
  * Allow specifying colors by CSS specification

Future work:
  * Operate without OpenSCAD
      * Internal CSG difference, triangulization, STL generation
      * But keep the SVG to SCAD part
