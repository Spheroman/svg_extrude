Code TODOs

Colors:
  * Implement explicitly listed colors
      * By css name
      * By HTML spec with optional name

Misc:
  * Are all SVG IDs OK for creating OpenSCAD identifiers?
  * Make sure we can't get collisions: an "outer" shape will currently create an
    "outer_only" module which will collide with an "outer_only" shape.

Cleanup:
  * Clean up method order in classes

Documentation:
  * Meaning of precision


Future work:
  * Single 3MF file with multiple objects
  * Output JSON
    This allows further processing by other tools without parsing the SCAD file.
  * Operate without OpenSCAD
      * CSG difference
      * Triangulation
      * Output file (STL, 3MF, potentially others) generation
  * Read SVG <desc> and/or <title> and write them as comments to the OpenSCAD
    file
  * Additional geometry on top of everything (configurable height), with
    optional color selection (default: color of the back-most shape)
  * Status message: groups, each with number of shapes and number of points
    OTOH, that's not really relevant because in does not consider clipping.
  * When using OpenSCAD for rendering, use OpenSCAD customizer to select groups
    instead of writing different SCAD files? This would allow rendering from the
    same file as written with --scad.
  * In ScadFile, define colors like `red = "#ff0000";`
  * Allow specifying the orgin, e. g. "bottom left" so it looks like in
    inkscape.
  * Do not subtract disjoint paths to reduce the number of difference CSG
    operations.
  * Configurable coordinate origin?
  * Configurable flipping: x (default), y, none, both
  * Reading available colors from JSON file
  * Option: file and group names use numeric colors, even if a name is defined
  * Consider using OpenSCAD primitives: cube, circle, text
